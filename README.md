# Hi, I'm Michael Abbott 👋

I am a **Professor of Theater** and **Chair of the Music Department** at **Wabash College**. My work lives at the intersection of performance, pedagogy, and digital storytelling, with a particular focus on how narrative functions across different media.

### 🎓 Academic & Creative Focus

* **Interactive Narrative:** Researching the evolution of storytelling and player agency within Role-Playing Games (RPGs).
* **Film & Media:** Analyzing the impact of film scores and global cinema trends.
* **Theater & Performance:** Writing and developing new works for the stage and exploring the future of the arts in higher education.

### 🔭 Currently Working On

* **World Cinema 2026:** Developing a comprehensive curriculum on global film history and theory.
* **RPG Seminar:** Designing a college-level course focused on the narrative structures of modern video games.
* **Digital Tools:** Experimenting with AI integration in the classroom and audio production via Audacity and RapidComposer.

### 🎙️ Beyond the Classroom

I have a long-standing history in the gaming community, formerly hosting **The Brainy Gamer** podcast. When I’m not in a rehearsal hall or a lecture hall, you can usually find me at a baseball game, traveling, or exploring the cultural significance of play.
